# Information Security Governance
## 1. Guiding principles
* Functional Security --> What should the system do?

    1. Control:  to prevent the exploitation of a systemâ€™s vulnerabilities 
    ```
    Classification according to the purpose of controls:
    - Preventitive: authentication based access
    - Detective: intrusion detection system
    - Corrective: restore data from back-up

    Classification according to the nature of controls:
    - Physical: who can access the data center
    - Procedural: incident response process
    - Technical: user authentication
    - Legal & regulatory/compliance: privacy laws
    ```

    2. Defense in depth & layered security:   
    Defense in depth requires multi-layered defense, but multi-layered defense may not necessarily provide defense in depth.

        |Terminology|Definition|
        |-|-|
        |Defense in depth|Multiple defense methods dealing with multiple attack vectors|
        |Layered security|Could be many layers defense methods in many attack vectors, and also could be defense methods in one attack vector|
    
    3. Need-to-know principle: The need-to-know principle describes a security objective to limit access to confidential information to what is absolutely necessary. 

    4. Least privilege access: same as Need-to-know principle.

    5. Secure by design.

    6. Zero trust.


* Security Assurance --> How to ensure the functions are achieved?

## 2. Standards and guidelines
Standards and guidelines are ***actionalbe*** compare with principles. In another word, priciple is ***abstract***, standard and guidelines are ***practical***.   

***Compliance***:  A product/organization/etc. adhering to the requirements of a standard.   
***Certified***:  Compliance vetted by an authoritative (and competent) entity.   

***ISO/IEC 27000***: Information security management systems (ISMS) family of standards: ISO27k.

***Common Criteria***: basis for evaluation of security properties of IT products.
