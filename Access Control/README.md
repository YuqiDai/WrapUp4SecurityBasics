## Access Control
### 1. Definition of Access Control
***Access control is a selective restriction of access to a place of resource.***   
Authentication is typically the first step for access control, after successful authentication, the system decides whether the request for accessing a place/resource is granted or not based on the predefined rules/policies.

### 2. Access Control Model
***Access control model is a scheme for specifying and 
enforcing security policies. There are different classifications of access control models***   
1. According to who decides the access rights to an object:
    * Discretionary Access Control -> DAC   
    ->*The owner of the object decides the rights. Example: the owner of a file decides who can read or 
write the file*
    * Mandatory Access Control -> MAC   
    ->*A policy administrator decides the policies, which must 
be followed by everyone in the system. Example: NTU does not allow the students to access 
the exam marks entry system*
2. According to how to store the security policies: 
    * Access Control Matrix

    * Capability-based Model

    * ACL-based Model

3. According to how to simplify the security policies: 
    * Role-based Access Control (RBAC)

    * Rule-based Access Control (RUBAC)
    * Multi-Level Security (MLS), such as BLP model and Biba model. Multi-level security (MLS) has been traditionally used in military organizations for document classification and personnel clearance.   
    MLS is type of mandatory access control model. Objects are classified into different security levels. Each user is assigned a security level.   
    There are two main MLS models:   
        * Bell-Lapadula model, for confidentiality.

        * Biba model, for integrity.
